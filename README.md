# Keyboard related stuff

In here I will collect everything I need to modify
my keyboards to my needs.

My keyboard is inspired by the article [A modern space cadet](http://stevelosh.com/blog/2012/10/a-modern-space-cadet/)
by Steve Losh. I used a german keyboard layout as a start, but modified
it a bit.

* [de-coding keyboard layout](https://github.com/bitboxer/de-coding.keylayout)
* [WASD V2 88-Key ISO Custom Layout](v1-layout.svg)
* [My settings](private.xml) for [Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/)

This is how my layout currently looks like:

Maybe this can inspire you to create your own layout.
