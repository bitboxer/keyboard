# Karabiner

Since MacOs Sierra the old [Karabiner app](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/index.html.en) is not working anymore.
Luckily the developer is working on a new app called [Karabiner-Elements](https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements)

With [Karabiner-Elements](https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements) I am
modifying the keyboard quiet a bit. What do I change?

* Caps Lock is `Escape`  on short press and `CTRL` on long press or in
  combination with another key
* The left `CTRL` key is remapped to a `HYPER` key, meaning it functions
  as a combination of `CTRL`+`ALT`+`CMD`. This enables another layer for
  shortcuts.

You can find my config in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/bitboxer/dotfiles/blob/master/tilde/config/karabiner/karabiner.json).
